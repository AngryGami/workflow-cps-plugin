- exception handling
  - both throwing and catching
  - I can make it a part of Env -> requires an interface and chaining
  - or I can make it a separate parameter
- block creates a new scope
- variables are resolved lexically
- async functions calling each other

Tests to be written:
    - verify a proper method overload resolution
    - trying to make constructor a workflow should be detected and rejected
