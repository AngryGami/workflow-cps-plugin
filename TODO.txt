- array access (trivial, so can be done later)
- closure
- debug information and stack trace fixup
- handle exceptions thrown from Block impls properly
- "synchronized" block
- finally block
- how do we handle multi-threading?

Tests to be written:
    - verify a proper method overload resolution
    - trying to make constructor a workflow should be detected and rejected
