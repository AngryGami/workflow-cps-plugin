- array access (trivial, so can be done later)
- debug information and stack trace fixup
- "synchronized" block
- finally block
- how do we handle multi-threading?
- instead of return Function, throw it, and report the arguments and so on to check direct/indirect
- serialization

Tests to be written:
    - verify a proper method overload resolution
    - trying to make constructor a workflow should be detected and rejected
